-- Quiz Project
This project is a Python-based quiz application that uses data analysis and a structured dataset to create an engaging quiz experience about movies and tv series. The project is organized into several components, each with a specific role in data preparation, analysis, and gameplay.

- Project Structure
py_project.py: This file performs descriptive analysis on the dataset. It generates insights and statistics that help understand the datasetâ€™s structure and content, providing valuable context for both the quiz content and game design.

dataset_merge.py: This file contains Python code that merges and creates two separate datasets. One dataset is used for the descriptive analysis in py_project.py, while the other is specifically tailored for the quiz game itself.

game.py: This is the main game execution file. Running this file launches the quiz game interface, where users can play and answer questions.

quiz.py: This file holds the core algorithm and logic for the quiz game. It includes essential functions like question selection, scoring, and answer validation, forming the backbone of the quiz experience.

- How to Run the Project
Run dataset_merge.py to generate the necessary datasets.
Use py_project.py for initial data analysis (optional but recommended to understand dataset insights).
Execute game.py to start and play the quiz.
